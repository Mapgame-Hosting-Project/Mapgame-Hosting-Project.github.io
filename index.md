# Mapgame Hosting Project

### The Mapgame Hosting Project aims to simplify the creation and management of [mapgames](https://mapgame.fandom.com/wiki/Map_Game_Rules).

## Resources and software

We have many tools for mapgamers to use to enhance their experience.

If you want to host a mapgame with minimal fuss, choose our [web option](http://mapgame-hosting.crumble-technologies.co.uk/Create/New/Web).

If you want to create a mapgame on Discord or integrate with an existing one on the platform, use our [Discord bot](http://mapgame-hosting.crumble-technologies.co.uk/Create/New/Discord).

## Documentation

The documentation of the two MHP packages is under construction.
